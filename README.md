# Lane Detection System using CAN (Lane Assistance)

## 📌 Abstract
In today’s fast-moving world, vehicles are essential for daily life, but this also increases the risk of accidents. Autonomous driving functions are becoming more prevalent to enhance safety. This project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Fuzzy Logic** to extract key features from road images and predict lane positions. The lane detection system is improved using a dual model based on instance segmentation, leveraging **Keras** and **TensorFlow** for deep learning-based lane detection. This system is designed for **real-time implementation**, ensuring quick response and accuracy.

## 🎯 Aim
The primary goal of this project is to develop an **accurate and reliable lane detection system** that recognizes and tracks lanes on highways using computer vision techniques.

## 🔍 Objectives
- To improve road safety by providing crucial lane information to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles.
- To enable automatic lane detection and assistance for enhanced driving efficiency.
- To implement a **CNN-based lane detection model** using Python and deep learning frameworks.
- To provide **enhanced lane departure warnings** with real-time visual and audio alerts.

## 📌 Introduction
When driving, we use our vision to determine where to go. Lane markings act as reference guides for steering the vehicle. However, reckless driving, incorrect lane selection, and lack of lane discipline contribute to accidents. The proposed **Lane Detection System** helps prevent such issues by predicting lanes and notifying drivers of lane deviations. In extreme cases, it can trigger automatic braking if a collision is imminent.

With **CNN**, we can extract significant features from road images and train a **tree-like regression model** for lane prediction. This technology enhances the functionality of autonomous vehicles by enabling automatic lane detection. The system is optimized for **real-time performance**, making it ideal for integration into self-driving cars and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

## 🧠 CNN Algorithm Overview
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a deep learning model designed for image processing and pattern recognition. It identifies key visual features such as edges, lines, and curves, making it highly effective for lane detection.

### Why CNN for Lane Detection?
- **Automatically detects lane lines** without manual feature extraction.
- **Processes raw images directly** without pre-processing.
- **Handles real-time lane tracking** with minimal computational overhead.
- **Hierarchical feature learning** enables the system to recognize lane structures even in complex environments.
- **Enhanced performance over traditional techniques** like Hough Transform, which struggles in complex lane conditions.

### CNN Model Structure
- **Input Layer**: Processes raw images of road lanes.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts essential lane features (edges, gradients, and shapes).
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduces dimensionality while retaining key features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classifies lane positions and predicts deviations.
- **Output Layer**: Provides lane boundary estimations for driver assistance.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time lane detection** using CNN and OpenCV.
- **Deep learning-based lane tracking** for improved accuracy.
- **Edge and contour detection** for lane markings.
- **Hough Transform-based lane recognition** (for comparison with deep learning methods).
- **CAN Bus Communication** for vehicle integration.
- **Automatic lane deviation alerts** (visual and audio feedback for driver assistance).

## 🌧 Handling Edge Cases
The system is trained to handle:
- **Low-light conditions** using adaptive brightness adjustments.
- **Adverse weather (rain, fog, snow)** with contrast-enhancing techniques.
- **Lane occlusions** using predictive lane continuation algorithms.
- **Faded or missing lane markings** by analyzing vehicle trajectory patterns.
